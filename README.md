## Hi..
Hello there! I'm Jordy Huijgens, and I'm exited to present my work on this backend assignment. I've embarked on this assignment with the goal of showcasing my skills and enthusiasm for joining your team. I believe this project not only demonstrates my technical capabilities but also reflects my commitment to delivering high-quality, well-structured code that aligns with industry standards. I'm excited to dive into this project and showcase my abilities.  

I'll be diligently working on this assignment, pushing regular updates to my private GitHub repository. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification on any aspect of my work. C;

Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team!
## Migration
The migrations are made using artisan like:
``` 
php artisan make:migration Movies
php artisan make:migration Series
php artisan make:migration Seasons
php artisan make:migration Episodes
``` 
## Models 

The models are made using artisan like: 
``` 
php artisan make:model Movie
php artisan make:model Series
php artisan make:model Season
php artisan make:model Episode
```

## Views

The views are made by using the following conventions:

- each subject gets its own folder (Movies, Series)
- the files are named as follows: 'action'-blade.php

So for instance in the Movies folder there will be a create-blade.php, this is used to create the local database records.

## Controllers

The controllers are made using artisan like:
``` 
php artisan make:controller MovieController
php artisan make:controller SeriesController
```
